UDP Client Server Communication :-
1 Server and many clients
1. Add motes : Motes->Create new Mote type->Sky Mote
For Server: Description == UDPSERVER -> Process == look in examples select ipv6 then select rpl-udp then select udp-server.c then clean once and then compile then create and select no.of server needed and then add mote
For Clients: Description == UDPCLIENT -> Process == look in examples select ipv6 then select rpl-udp then select udp-client.c then clean once and then compile then create and select no.of clients needed and then add mote

CoAP : -
3 components needed: = 1. Server ; 2. Client and 3. Router Border
Border router is used to connect with internet(external world)
REST protocol is used 
1. Select sky mote and description == RPL BORDER ROUTER
then select examples folder and select ipv6 and select rpl border router and then select border_router.c  file
2. Then clean-> compile-> create(select no. of BR =1 here)
3. Now create server and connect to border router
Similarly select sky mote and description==REST_Server
4.Now go to examples -> er_rest_example -> er_example_server.c
then clean ; compile and create (no.of servers == 1)
5. Now add clients (similar to server but select er_example_client.c)
6. Rearrange the motes such tht server is in range of border router and clients are in range of server only
START NOW SIMULATION 
7. Now we need to enable the Border (configure it as public)
1st right click border then select mote tools  and then serial socket server then see port no. written there and start it THEN do following 
In terminal write
cd contiki-3.0 -> cd examples -> cd ipv6 -> cd rpl-border-router 
-> make connect-router-cooja

After this SErver IPv6 address will be printed copy that which is your public ip address and used for commn with world
Go to browser write [ip address copied]
